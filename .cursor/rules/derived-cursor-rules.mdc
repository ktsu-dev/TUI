## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a .NET library designed for building text-based user interfaces (TUIs). It supports console providers like Spectre.Console and focuses on rendering UI primitives and composing complex UI components. The architecture follows a Contracts, Models, Services pattern, adhering to SOLID and DRY principles.

## TECH STACK

*   .NET (Specify version when available)
*   Spectre.Console (for console provider support), version 0.49.1 was used during initial development.
*   Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions (Version 8.0.1)
*   Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions (Version 8.0.1)

## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

*   **Contracts:** Defines interfaces for services and data structures.
*   **Models:** Represents the data used within the application.
*   **Services:** Implements the business logic and interacts with the console.
*   **Elements:** Base classes and primitives for UI elements.
*   **Layouts:** Classes for composing complex UI components

The architecture is based on SOLID and DRY principles to ensure maintainability and testability.

## CODING STANDARDS

*   Follow established .NET coding conventions.
*   Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
*   Follow DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) to avoid code duplication.
*   Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes.
*   Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
*   Copyright headers must be included in all files:
    ```csharp
    // Copyright (c) ktsu.dev
    // All rights reserved.

## DEBUGGING

When running tests:

*   Use `dotnet test` to execute tests.
*   `dotnet test` might not show test results clearly, use more specific commands if needed.
*   `dotnet test --verbosity normal` provides more detailed output.
*   `dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` provides the most detailed output.
*   `dotnet test TUI.Test --logger trx --logger "console;verbosity=normal"` runs tests for a specific project with detailed console and trx logger output.
*   If encountering SDK-related issues, ensure the correct SDK is installed and configured in `global.json`.
*   If using central package version management, ensure no explicit versions are defined in `PackageReference` items, but are defined in `Directory.Packages.props`.
*   When test project fails to build, try running test project directly without building the whole solution: `cd TUI.Test && dotnet test --no-build --no-restore`
*   If tests fail due to missing MSTest using statements, add `using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;` to the top of the test file.
*   When tests are failing due to code analysis warnings, add `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CA1720;CA1805;CA1716;CA1848;CA1307;CA1062;CA1822;CA1031;CA1707;CA1515</NoWarn>` to a `Directory.Build.props` file in the root of the repository.

## UI PRIMITIVES

*   **TextElement:** A UI element that displays text with styling options (font, color, alignment, word wrap).
*   **BorderElement:** A UI element that draws a border around content, supporting different border styles and titles.

## UI COMPONENT COMPOSITION

*   **StackPanel:** A container that arranges child elements in a horizontal or vertical stack.
*   **BorderElement:** Inherits from `UIContainerBase` and uses the `Children` collection to store child elements, not a `Child` property. However, a `Child` property is provided as a convenience for single-child scenarios.
